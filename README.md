The item draft was completed on 2.21. This enables the items to be picked up and detected by NPCs. Scary NPC script and player health finished on 2.22. Change interact from click F to click the mouse. 2.27, Added a visual inspection mode for picking up items.I also wrote the script and dialogue for the mission NPC, enabling it to have conversations and make choices. I also asked Zoe to do the beautification work.

In the Unity Scene, I created mesh colliders for the ground and walls. I created the Player GameObject and attached all the components needed
such as Rigidbody and colliders. I created the player singleton and wrote code for player movement in the FixedUpdate() method:
Vector3 movement = transform.forward * vertical * _moveSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime; This was for forward and backwards movement. 
_playerRigidbody.MovePosition(_playerRigidbody.position + movement); rotate float turn = horizontal * _turnSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime; 
Quaternion turnRotation = Quaternion.Euler(0, turn, 0); _playerRigidbody.MoveRotation(_playerRigidbody.rotation * turnRotation); This was for player 
rotation movement. Our scripts were originally coupled and the Player script, UI, and Inventory called directly from each other. I wrote a new script
GameEvents to decouple the code to adhere to a Model-View-Controller pattern. I wrote the player events public static Action<int> OnHealthChanged; and 
public static Action OnPlayerDied; so that the player script can invoke the events if the player's health changed or if the player died and script 
such as the UI can subscribe to the event and call its own method. In the UI script I added the following code to onEnable():  GameEvents.OnHealthChanged 
+= SetHealth; GameEvents.OnPlayerDied += ShowGameOver; The event for UI in GameEvents is public static Action OnGameStarted; and the event for 
inventory is public static Action<ItemId> OnItemPickedUp; public static Action<ItemId> OnItemRemoved; These events are also so that the three scripts 
didn't need a direct reference to each other. 

I think our proposal and breakdwon was pretty helpful to start building our game. The proposal gave us the foundation in what we 
needed to start building and coding. The breakdown also gave us the foundation to start coding scripts but it mostly only covered the basic concepts 
and we came across more specific things that needed more details such as we thought a GameController might be able to manage the overall gameplay but 
we ended up splitting the items and inventory and related gameplay to separate scripts.
